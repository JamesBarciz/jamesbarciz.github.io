### A Brief Background

My name is James Barciz and I am from the small town of Waynesboro, Pennsylvania where I currently reside.  Before attending Lambda School for Data Science, I received my Bachelor of Arts degree in French focusing on Translation.  In my free time I enjoy playing cello with a local community orchestra, singing with several choirs around my area as well as singing solo repertoire as a classically-trained baritone.
